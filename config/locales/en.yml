# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  expand_your_reach_desc: When it comes to online art sales,
   the world is your oyster. You can reach people in other states and other countries,
   Plus, you can reach an entirely different audience. The online market allows for buyers who
   normally would feel uncomfortable with the intimidating settings of a gallery to discover art.
   Buyers can now build a collection from the comfoert of their own home. 
   this is your chance to cultivate a previously untapped group of art buyers - that's good
   for you and great for the art market as a whole.
  we_do_the_marketing_desc: Selling art on your on site requires a daily hustle.
   You need to promote your latest work on Facebook and Twitter. You need to create a blog or
   maintain a newsletter to keep potential buyers interested.
   Some online art galleries have millions of dollers to invest in driving traffic to your work. granted,
   they often represent thousands of articles, But a successful site can introduce your work to interested buyers without you 
   having to lift a finger.
  suppliment_your_income_desc: Let's face it, making a living as an artist is no easy
    task. Even some veteran artists can struggle to
    maintain a consistent income month after month.
    Selling reproductions of your work online can
    supplement your income. Commission at an online
    gallery is generally a lot lower than a brick and
    mortar gallery. It can range from 1-5% on the low
    end and 10% on the high end. Websites can do this
    because they have lower overhead costs. However, if
    you are currently selling your art through galleries,
    be sure not to undersell them. It is very important to
    maintain positive relationships with the ones
    helping you sell your art.
